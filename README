# WORKING TITLE

ONE SHOT HYPER-MODAL GENERATIVE SEARCH

# ABSTRACT

Traditional search engines emerged as a response to the need to make sense of the information; extract knowledge from information, that slowly and then all at once became available to the networked users. Traditional search engines revolutionized the way people interact with information - they enabled agency, allowing users to personalize the knowledge they accumulate. 

ML models are what we believe are compression engines. They generate a wealth of new knowledge at an unprecedented rate way above human capabilities of content generation; yet this new knowledge is challenging to navigate. 

This is changing with the introduction of generative search engines. In “As Generative Search Engines: Initial Experiments”, the authors state that “it will eventually become as common to search for images that don’t exist yet, as it currently is to search for images that do exist” - and we agree with this statement though in a partial capacity – we believe search as all information is intrinsically multimodal in nature. 

Generative search engines generate and then walk in this latent space to explore and extract data contextualized to the user's intent. Prompting (e.g. text to image) is one instance of generative search engine. But why stop at images? The generative search approach seamlessly transitions to multimodal instances across video, audio, image, and text as well, given the pure mathematical nature of this high dimensional latent space,


We want to take it a step further and apply the generative search approach to multimodal ML pipelines - combinations and forking and finetuning of models for downstream tasks; creating hyper-personalized outputs. This will make it possible to navigate new landscapes of generated data from the learned representations.

This allows us to store compressed representations which filter out noise in the information and store meaningful data that can be aligned with multimodal user input to sample these representations.


Each of the models unlocks knowledge that can be navigated. However, there are no instruments capable of navigating the knowledge generated by combinations of models. Generative search engines can help explore this latent space. 

We believe that investing in the research and infrastructure on generative search engines for data generated by these multimodal ML will have outsized benefits for Stability AI where capabilities of such models and search will only scale exponentially with time.  A generative search engine would serve as a force-multiplier of the value produced by each of the models as it accelerates the amount of data/knowledge available for exploration. 

As soon as any Stability AI’s model becomes a part of an ML multimodal pipeline AND the knowledge produced out of these pipelines can be navigated, the value of each model would compound.
